## Description
- This was my computer Science 2 final project during my first year at University of Wisconsin-Stout.
- I wanted to challenge myself with a tile-scrolling 2D platformer. This was my first time making a game in java and I used many work arounds to finish it on time, so there are many areas of improvement in the code.
- There are 4 levels:
1. Grass 1 -- Easy and teaches controls (Has secret exit)
2. Grass 2 -- Difficult (Has secret exit)
3. Ring City -- Very difficult. (I wanted one challenging level for the project)
4. Chess World -- Player changes into different chess pieces the have different abilities

Make your own levels with the level editor too!
